 <li>Let, solve <em>Ax </em>= <em>b </em>for <em>x </em>using three different methods

  <ul>

   <li>Find a LU decomposition of <em>A </em>and use substitution and back substitution to find <em>x</em>.</li>

   <li>Use Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix.</li>

   <li>Use Gauss-Jordan elimination to find the inverse of <em>A </em>first and then let <em>x </em>= <em>A</em><sup>−1</sup><em>x</em>.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Row reduce the following matrix <em>A </em>and then find its rank, nullity, pivot columns and a basis for <em>range</em>(<em>A</em>) and <em>null</em>(<em>A</em>). Note, you could row-reduce it to an upper-triangular matrix or a non-reduced row echelon form or a reduced row echelon form. Row-reducing to an upper triangular matrix involves the least amount of row operations but reducing to a reduced row echelon form makes it easier to find the rank, nullity etc.</li>
